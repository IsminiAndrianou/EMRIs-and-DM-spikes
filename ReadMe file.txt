The scripts in this repository can be used to generate EMRI waveforms in the presence of dynamic DM spikes. 

They use the Fast EMRI Waveforms framework, Version v1.0.0, published August 27, 2020, as is available on https://zenodo.org/records/4005001 and https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms to generate the waveforms and a modified version of HaloFeedback, original available at https://zenodo.org/records/3688813 and https://github.com/bradkav/HaloFeedback to evolve the DM density of the spike simultaneously with the EMRI. 

Requirements:
FEW version v1.0.0 installed with all requirements mentioned in the relevant installation guide. If you use a newer version of FEW, minor adaptions to the scripts in this repository may be needed.
